ansible-mysql
=============

Hello Folks, this is a short playbook I created during my leisure as I was trying to shift from Puppet to a new beast "Ansible"
Ansible requires no agent running on the client machine and that impressed me altogether.

This playbook has two roles - db and web. The db role takes care of mysql server installation while web takes care of installation of python with pip modules.I have added MySQL DB user and DB creation with GRANT ALL to blog user under db roles

Feel free to clone it and enjoy the coffee break !!!
